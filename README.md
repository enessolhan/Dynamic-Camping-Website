# Camping Project


### YelpCamp is very extensive, and complex app which I worked on. Instead of just applying basic blog app features, I added authentication, cookies and sessions, Authorization, SQL Injection, and XSS for security, Image upload and storage, Maps and Geocoding. You can go and look Github codes and live code of this project.
